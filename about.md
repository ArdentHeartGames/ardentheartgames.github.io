# About Ardent Heart Editor

## Overview

The Ardent Heart Editor is a next-generation game development tool designed to make game creation accessible, powerful, and enjoyable. Built on modern web technologies, it combines the flexibility of browser-based development with the performance of cutting-edge rendering engines.

## The Editor

### Architecture

The Ardent Heart Editor is architected around three core principles:

1. **Accessibility** - A clean, intuitive interface that doesn't sacrifice power for simplicity
2. **Performance** - Leveraging hardware-accelerated rendering for smooth, responsive editing
3. **Extensibility** - Plugin architecture and scripting support for custom workflows

### Key Components

- **Scene Editor** - Visual layout and composition of game scenes
- **Asset Manager** - Centralized management of sprites, textures, audio, and other resources
- **Script Editor** - Integrated code editor with syntax highlighting and debugging
- **Preview System** - Real-time game preview without leaving the editor
- **Inspector Panel** - Property editing for game objects and components

## The Unicorn Game Engine

At the heart of the editor lies the **Unicorn Game Engine** - a lightweight, modular game engine designed for:

- **Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture** for flexible game object management
- **Scene management** with loading, unloading, and transitions
- **Physics integration** for realistic object interactions
- **Input handling** across multiple input devices
- **Audio management** with spatial sound support

### Why Unicorn?

The Unicorn Game Engine was created to provide a clean separation between the editor tools and the runtime engine. This means:

- Games built with Ardent Heart Editor can run independently of the editor
- The engine is optimized for runtime performance, not editing overhead
- Clean APIs make it easy to extend and customize

## Rendering Technologies

### PixiJS Integration

**PixiJS** powers our 2D rendering capabilities, providing:

- Hardware-accelerated WebGL rendering
- Comprehensive sprite and texture management
- Advanced particle systems
- Rich text rendering
- Filter and effects support

### ThreeJS Integration (Coming Soon)

We're actively integrating **ThreeJS** to bring 3D capabilities to the editor:

- Full 3D scene support alongside 2D content
- PBR (Physically Based Rendering) materials
- Advanced lighting and shadows
- 3D model import and manipulation
- Camera controls and cinematic tools

## Technology Stack

The Ardent Heart Editor is built with:

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Rendering**: PixiJS (2D), ThreeJS (3D - in development)
- **Build Tools**: Modern bundlers and development tools
- **Version Control**: Git-based project management

## Philosophy

We believe that game development tools should:

- **Empower creators** with professional-grade features
- **Reduce friction** between idea and implementation
- **Foster experimentation** through rapid iteration
- **Support collaboration** with version control and sharing features
- **Remain accessible** to developers of all skill levels

## Open Development

The Ardent Heart Editor is being developed with community feedback in mind. We believe in transparency and iterative improvement, which is why we maintain this public site with regular updates on our progress.
