# Development Roadmap

Our high-level roadmap for the Ardent Heart Editor. This roadmap is subject to change based on community feedback and development priorities.

## Current Status: Pre-Early Access Development

We are currently in active development, working towards our Early Access launch on Steam. The editor is functional for 2D game development with core features implemented.

**Early Access Launch**: Q1 2026 (could be sooner)
**Current Access**: Invite-only until Early Access launch
