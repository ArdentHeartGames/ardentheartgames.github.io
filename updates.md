## Community and Feedback

We're building this editor with the community in mind. 

### Before Early Access

The editor is currently in **invite-only access** as we prepare for the public Early Access launch. This allows us to:

- Gather focused feedback from early adopters
- Identify and fix critical issues
- Polish the user experience
- Finalize core features

### Early Access & Beyond

Once we launch on Steam Early Access (Q1 2026, could be sooner), the editor will be:

- **Exclusively available on Steam**
- Open to the public for purchase and use
- Actively developed with regular updates
- Enhanced with **Steam Workshop** for community plugins
- Expanded with **Steam DLC** for official plugin releases

### How to Get Involved (Post-Early Access)

- **Use the editor** - Create games and share your feedback
- **Steam Workshop** - Create and share plugins with the community
- **Community discussion** - Participate in Steam forums and discussions
- **Feature requests** - Help shape the roadmap with your ideas

## Technical Updates

### Recent Improvements

**Week of January 1-7, 2026:**
- Set up project infrastructure

## Coming Soon

### Near-term Plans

- **Documentation Portal** - Comprehensive guides and API reference
- **Example Projects** - Sample games and demos to learn from
- **Tutorial Series** - Step-by-step guides for common tasks

### Feature Highlights to Watch

#### Visual Animation Editor
Create animations with a visual timeline interface. This will make it easy to animate sprites, properties, and create complex animation sequences without writing code.

#### Visual Scripting System
For those who prefer visual programming, we're planning a node-based scripting system that will work alongside TypeScript scripting.

#### ThreeJS 3D Support
Full 3D game development capabilities are coming, allowing you to create immersive 3D experiences or mix 2D and 3D elements in your games.
