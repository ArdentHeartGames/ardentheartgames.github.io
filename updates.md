## Community and Feedback

We're building this editor with the community in mind. As we progress through development, we'll be looking for:

- **Beta Testers** - Help us identify bugs and usability issues
- **Feature Suggestions** - Tell us what features would make your workflow better
- **Example Projects** - Share what you've built with the editor
- **Documentation Feedback** - Help us improve our guides and tutorials

### How to Get Involved

Currently, the project is in early development. As we approach our first alpha release, we'll be opening up opportunities for:

- Early access testing programs
- Community forums and discussion
- Feature voting and prioritization
- Contributing to documentation and examples

Stay tuned for announcements about community involvement opportunities!
